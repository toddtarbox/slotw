Soccer Leagues of the World - Android Sample Application
============

This is a sample Android application that demonstrates the use of [ESPN's](http://developer.espn.com) public API. This application is limited to what the public API exposes. This is a very basic app that may be expanded
in the future.

This application will present a list of countries that have professional soccer leagues. Selecting a country from the list will load all professional soccer leagues in that country. Selecting a league will then load all
teams in that league. Each team listing then contains a link to load that team via [ESPN FC](http://www.espnfc.com/).


Install
============
The latest debug version of the application is available for download by selecting the .apk from the list of files on this page. You will need to enable the "Unknow sources" option under "Security" on your Android device
in order to allow applications to be installed outside of the Google Play Store.
