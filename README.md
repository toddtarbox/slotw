Soccer Leagues of the World - Android Sample Application
============

This is a sample Android application that demonstrates the use of [ESPN's](http://developer.espn.com) public API. This application is limited to what the public API exposes. This is a very basic app that may be expanded
in the future.

This application will present a list of countries that have professional soccer leagues. Selecting a country from the list will load all professional soccer leagues in that country. Selecting a league will then load all
teams in that league. Each team listing then contains a link to load that team via [ESPN FC](http://www.espnfc.com/).


Install
============
[The latest debug version of the application is available for download.](https://github.com/toddtarbox/slotw/blob/master/app-debug.apk)
You will need to enable the "Unknow sources" option under "Security" on your Android device
in order to allow applications to be installed outside of the Google Play Store.
